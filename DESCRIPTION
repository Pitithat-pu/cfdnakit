Description: This package provides basic functions for analyzing shallow whole-genome sequencing (~0.3X or more) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The package basically extracts the length of cfDNA fragments and aids the vistualization of fragment-length information. The package also extract fragment-length information per non-overlapping fixed-sized bins and used it for calculating ctDNA estimation score (CES).
